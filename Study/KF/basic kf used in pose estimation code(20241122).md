Kalman Filter Explanation for Pose Estimation
The Kalman Filter (KF) is used to estimate the state of a dynamic system (e.g., the position and orientation of a camera) by combining predictions from a motion model with noisy observations. Below is an intuitive breakdown of its components and workflow in the context of your pose estimation code.

Components of the Kalman Filter
1. State Vector (x)
The state vector represents the system's current state, including:

Position: 
[
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
]
[x,y,z] (3D translation)
Velocity: 
[
𝑣
𝑥
,
𝑣
𝑦
,

𝑧
]
[v 
x
​
 ,v 
y
​
 ,v

​
 ] (rate of change of position)
Acceleration:

]
[a

​
 ,a

This results in an 18-dimensional state vector:

2. Transition Matrix (A)
The transition matrix describes how the state evolves over time. It predicts the next state by accounting for motion dynamics (e.g., velocity affecting position, acceleration affecting velocity):

dt: Time interval between measurements.
The matrix includes dependencies between position, velocity, and acceleration.
3. Measurement Vector (z)
The measurement vector represents noisy observations, including:

Position: 
[
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
]
[x,y,z]
Orientation: 
[

4. Measurement Matrix (H)
The measurement matrix maps the state vector (x) to the measurement space (z). For instance:

Extracts position 
[
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
]
[x,y,z] and orientation 
[
𝑟
𝑜
𝑙
𝑙
,
𝑝
𝑖
𝑡
𝑐
ℎ
,
𝑦
𝑎
𝑤
]
[roll,pitch,yaw] from the state vector.
5. Process Noise Covariance (Q)
Represents uncertainty in the model’s predictions, accounting for small random changes (e.g., jerks, angular fluctuations).

6. Measurement Noise Covariance (R)
Represents uncertainty in the sensor measurements (e.g., noise in the position or orientation estimates).

7. Error Covariance Matrix (P)
Tracks the uncertainty in the state estimate over time. It is updated during each prediction and correction step.

Workflow of the Kalman Filter
1. Prediction Step
Uses the transition matrix (A) to predict the next state (x_{k|k-1}) and updates the error covariance (P_{k|k-1}):

2. Correction Step
Uses the measurement (z_k) and Kalman Gain (K) to refine the prediction:

K: Kalman Gain, determines how much to trust the prediction vs. the measurement.
x_k: Updated state estimate.
P_k: Updated error covariance.
Application in the Pose Estimation Code
Prediction: The KF predicts the next camera pose (position and orientation) based on the current state and the transition matrix.
Correction: After solving PnP for the camera pose, the KF uses the measurement (z_k) to refine the predicted state. This ensures smoother and more stable estimates.
Key Benefits
Handles Noise: Smooths out noisy PnP estimates by combining predictions with measurements.
Improves Stability: Produces continuous and realistic pose transitions even with missing or inconsistent measurements.
